## Project Description
The Secure Password Generator is a Python-based application that generates strong, random passwords based on user-specified criteria. This project helps users create passwords that are secure and difficult to guess, supporting criteria such as length, inclusion of uppercase letters, digits, and symbols. The project can be run in a console-based format, with an optional GUI built using Tkinter to provide a more user-friendly interface.

## Features
* **Password Criteria Selection:** Users can specify the password length and select character types (uppercase letters, numbers, symbols) to customize the strength of their password.
* **Random Password Generation:** The program generates a password based on selected criteria, ensuring it meets security standards.
* **Display Generated Password:** The password is shown to the user immediately after generation.
* **Copy to Clipboard:** Users can copy the generated password to the clipboard with a single click in the GUI version.
* **Optional GUI:** A graphical interface (optional) built using Tkinter allows easy interaction with the application.
## Technologies Used
* **Python:** Core functionality for password generation logic.
* **Tkinter:** For building the optional graphical user interface (GUI).
* **Pyperclip:** Provides clipboard support for copying generated passwords (optional, depending on version).
## How to Use
##### 1. Console Version 
* Run the script in a Python environment.
* Follow the prompts to enter your desired password criteria, including length and character types.
* The generated password will be displayed in the console.
##### 2. GUI Version (Optional)
* Run the script with Tkinter installed.
* In the GUI window, set the desired password length and select character options (uppercase, digits, symbols).
* Click "Generate Password" to create a password based on your preferences.
* Use the "Copy to Clipboard" button to copy the generated password.
## Future Enhancements
* **Password Strength Indicator:** Display a strength rating for generated passwords.
* **Password History:** Allow users to save previously generated passwords.
* **Additional Character Options:** Include user-defined characters or exclude specific characters for more customized passwords.
* **Save to File:** Enable saving generated passwords to a local file.
